# Word2Vec_Gensim
I gonna use gensim to change whole phrases into vectors and do some operations on the text
# Link to the Dataset: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5.json.gz
# When i want to load a json dataset i need to specify "lines = True" it means that json objects will be sorted into lines
# I check shape, it is very big, I check first review 
# I gonna use "utils.simple_preprocess" from gensim to tokenize the first sentence
